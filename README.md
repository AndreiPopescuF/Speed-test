# Speed test application
This code is a Python program that creates a simple typing speed test application using the tkinter library for GUI (Graphical User Interface). Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Imports necessary modules: tkinter for GUI components, time for timing operations, threading for managing threads, and random for generating random sample texts.

Defines a class named SpeedTest.

Initializes the GUI by creating a tkinter window (Tk()), setting its title, size, and loading sample text from a file named "text.txt".

Creates GUI elements:

A label (sample_label) to display a random sample text.
An entry widget (input_entry) for users to type.
A label (speed_label) to display typing speed statistics.
A button (reset_button) to reset the test.
Binds the start method to the <KeyRelease> event of the input_entry. This method is triggered when a key is released while typing.

Defines the start method which checks if the test is already running. If not, it starts a new thread (time_thread) to calculate typing speed statistics.

Checks if the entered text matches the sample text and changes the text color accordingly.

Defines the time_thread method which calculates typing speed statistics (characters per second, characters per minute, words per second, and words per minute) while the test is running.

Defines the reset method to reset the test by stopping the test, resetting counters, and updating GUI elements.

Creates an instance of the SpeedTest class, which starts the GUI application.

Overall, this code creates a simple typing speed test application where users type a given sample text, and the application calculates and displays their typing speed in characters per second, characters per minute, words per second, and words per minute. The application also provides a reset button to start the test again with a new sample text.
